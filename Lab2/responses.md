2. It is important to choose a liscense for your software because the way in which others may use your software must be explicitly specified. To avoid any legal issues and ensure others use your software and source code only as you envision, it is important to pick a liscense that best suits your needs and intentions in the software you create. 

3. If a project does not have an explicit liscense it should not be used because the purpose witch which the original creator made it is not explicity stated. By default, a project without a liscense is assumed to have the strictest intellectual property laws protecting it, and thus is not ideal to use for your own open source project. 

4. It seems that HTTP succeeded because it put less resposibility on a small group of people, unlike Gopher, and instead placed the power mostly in the hands of authours of content on the web. This model allowed it to expand at a rate that Gopher could not keep up with entirely due to the nature of its structure. Gopher rand into issues with forking and was unable to focus on one specific goal, instead its developers focused on specific goals and the lack of a centralized goal. 

5. Linux uses the GPL v2 Liscense so that in addition to the official Linux release that can be officially maintained, there is also avaliability for anyone to take the use and redistribute it. Because Linux is "Unix-like" and also open source, it gives the public access to work and create freely in this Unix-Like environment.
